# Skyrim-Save-File-Image-Extractor

This script, when ran and given the location of a Skyrim save file, will read the file and parse the data for the screenshot of the last thing the player was looking at when they saved the game. Afterwards, the screenshot will be formatted and saved as a bitmap image.
